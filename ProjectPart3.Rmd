\section*{Introduction}
Pokemon Go became an overnight sensation with hundreds of millions of people having downloaded the mobile game. The whole point of the game is to try to catch all the Pokemon available and train them (increase their combat power, which is abbreviated cp) so that you can battle other players with your strengthened Pokemon. A quick note about Pokemon is that they can evolve into stronger forms, so an evolved Pokemon will generally always have a higher cp than a non-evolved Pokemon. A number of people have tried to generate models in an attempt to predict the best way to maximize cp for their Pokemon. This is what we will attempt to do ourselves: create a model to predict combat power for an evolved Pokemon. 

To refresh your memory, the dataset we are looking at is an original data set collected by $OpenIntro^1$, most likely by some individual who was playing Pokemon Go and decided to record data. The dataset contains 75 observations across 26 variables, with each observation representing a randomly generated Pokemon that the gamer caught. Four species are represented in this data, so the conclusions drawn from this modeling process will reflect the population of these 4 particular species: Eevee, Pidgey, Caterpie, and Weedle. 

We avoid using "new" variables in our modeling process because as a user, you wouldn't have access to any of the "new" information, but if you're interested in whether your pokemon will evolve into one with a high cp ($cp\_new$), you would want to know which of the Pokemon's current stats can indicate a high $cp\_new$. The variables that we are particularly interested in are cp, hp, and power_up_stardust. Our intuition is that a pokemon with a higher cp might evolve into a pokemon with a higher cp. Hp, or hit points, refers to the amount of damage a Pokemon can sustain in battle before fainting. It would be interesting to see whether a Pokemon with high hp will also have high cp. Power up stardust is used to raise cp of the pokemon, but the catch here is we don't know the ideal amount of power up stardust to max out the $cp\_new$ of the evolved pokemon.

\section*{Exploratory Analysis}

The first thing we did was comb through the dataset again to spot any outliers or weird data. As we hinted towards in Part II of our Pokemon Go regression project, all the Eevee data points seem to be outliers (their stats were way higher than the other Pokemons' stats). A question will we look into is what will the model look like if the Eevee outliers are removed. 

The second thing, which we didn't catch the first time around, was that for Weedle and Caterpie, their $attack\_strong\_value$ was lower than the $attack\_weak\_value.$ At first glance, this didn't make sense because the $attack\_strong\_value$ should be _higher_ than the $attack\_weak\_value.$ The name of the strong attack is "Struggle", and upon further research, we found that Struggle is actually the default second move. In other words Weedle and Caterpie don't have two attacks, one strong and one weak, but rather just a single attack. We still chose to include $attack\_strong\_value$ in our model fitting process because it might contain information important for predictions. 

We also looked at what variables should/should not be included in the model selection process. As we have mentioned in the introduction, we removed all the "new" variables because they are not accessible for users and thus irrelevant to our model. Furthermore, we found out that "attack_strong", "attack_strong_type", "attack_weak" and "attack_weak_type" indicates the exact same information as "attack_strong_value" and "attack_weak_value". Therefore we removed all the "type" variables to avoid multicollinearity. As a result, the number of explanatory variables for model building is reduced from 26 to 9. 

The next thing we did was check the relationships between our explanatory variables as well as between the explanatory variables and the response variable. 

\subsubsection{Pairs Plots}
```{r,include=FALSE}
pokemon2<-pokemon %>%
  select(cp_new,cp,species,hp,weight,attack_strong_value,power_up_stardust)
```

```{r,fig.height=8,fig.width=13,echo=FALSE}
ggpairs(pokemon2,aes(col=species))
```
Here, we've only included certain variables for ease of presentation; however, you can see the full correlation plot on our GitHub. When looking at the pairs plots between continuous variables, several things stood out to us.
\begin{enumerate}

\item $cp\_new$ is highly correlated with cp and hp. It's telling that cp is highly correlated with $cp\_new$ because that means that a pokemon with a higher starting cp can be expected to have a higher $cp\_new$ post-evolution.

\item cp is highly correlated with hp, so perhaps we don't need both in the model if we are looking for a more parsimonious model. Although, since we are trying to fit a predictive model, maybe having more predictor variables might be to our benefit (more variability explained)

\item Previously, we had log-transformed hp because there were issues of non-constant variance when plotted against $cp\_new$. Looking at the pairs plots, there may be the same issues of non-constant variance with $cp$ and $hp$, which will have to be checked with residual plots. 

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Model Building}
```{r,include=FALSE}
pokemon_model<-pokemon %>%
  select(-name,-notes) %>%
  select(-hp_new,-power_up_stardust_new,-attack_strong_value_new,-attack_weak_value_new,-weight_new,-height_new,-power_up_candy_new,-attack_strong_type_new,-attack_weak_type_new,-attack_strong_new,-attack_weak_new) %>%
  select(-attack_strong_type,-attack_weak_type,-attack_strong,-attack_weak)
```


\subsection{Note on Interactions}

```{r,echo=FALSE}
p1 <- qplot(x = hp, y = cp_new, color = species, data = pokemon) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
grid.arrange(p1, nrow=1,ncol=1 ,bottom="Figure 1: Plot of hp vs. cp_new demonstrating interaction by species")
```

Since our last installment working on this data project, one of the things we noticed was that the $cp\_new$ vs hp model did not adequately describe the Eevee data points. Here, we decided to color by species, and from this plot (Figure 1), it's clear that species interacts with hp in predicting $cp\_new$ (the slopes are different). In other words, the effect of hp on $cp\_new$ depends on the species of Pokemon. 

Based on layman knowledge of the game, it would make sense that these effects change by species since some species are naturally stronger or weaker (Eevee is a mystical mammal while Caterpie and Weedle are essentially your everyday garden worms in the Pokemon universe).

Thus, in the model building process outlined below, we've decided to provide the algorithms with the choice of including interaction terms.  

\subsection{Model Selection}

We tried different model building procedures, specifically best subsets and forward and backward stepwise regression. Briefly, best subsets looks at all combinations of predictors and picks the best based on the following criteria that we chose: BIC, $R^2_adj$, and Mallow's $C_p$ and stepwise regression starts with an empty model and adds the best available variable to the model at each step making sure to drop variables that become less important as the model selection process moves forward. 

We ran the algorithm on all variables including interaction terms. The best model from this round of selection was: $cp\_new$ ~ cp + species + $attack\_strong\_value$ + weight + cp:species + species:$attack\_strong\_value$ + species:weight which resulted from stepwise regression. The selection criteria we used were AIC, $R^2$, and $R^2_{adj}$. 

\subsection{Diagnostics}
\subsubsection{Residuals}
```{r,include=FALSE}
lm1 <- lm(cp_new ~ cp + species + attack_strong_value + weight + cp:species + species:attack_strong_value + species:weight, data = pokemon)
res1 <- resid(lm1)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
plot(pokemon$cp_new, res1, ylab="Residuals", xlab="cp_new", main="Pokemon cp_new") 
abline(0, 0) 
```

```{r,include=FALSE}
pokemon_logged <- pokemon_model %>%
  mutate(cp_new=log(cp_new),cp=log(cp))
names(pokemon_logged)[2] <- c("cp_log")
names(pokemon_logged)[10] <- c("cp_new_log")

lm2 <- lm(cp_new_log ~ cp_log + species + attack_strong_value + weight + cp_log:species + species:attack_strong_value + species:weight, data = pokemon_logged)
res2 <- resid(lm2)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
p2 <- ggplot(data = pokemon_logged, aes(x = cp_new_log, y = res2))+ ylab("Residuals")+xlab("log(cp_new)") + geom_point() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=0, linetype = "solid")
grid.arrange(p2,nrow=1,ncol=1,bottom="Figure 2: Residual Plot of Logged Model")
```

We created a residual plot on our first round model $cp\_new$ ~ cp + species + $attack\_strong\_value$ + weight + cp:species + species:$attack\_strong\_value$ + species:weight. We observed unequal and non-normal variance which corresponded to the Eevees and issues with heteroscedasticity, so we decided to log-transform $cp\_new$ as well as cp, since we noticed that cp had a wide range of values during our exploratory analysis. As a result, our log-transformed values resulted in the "random scatter" that we love seeing in residual plots (Figure 2). Having log-transformed variables will improve our model appropriateness.

\subsubsection{Outliers and Influential Points}
We ran a Bonferonni test procedure to see if we had outlying Y residuals, those whose studentized deleted residuals were large in absolute value. We also ran diagnostic tests to look for influential points. We ran a test of DFFITS, which is the measure of the influence pokemon $i$ has on model-fitted $cp\_new$. From DFFITS, we saw that all the Eevees had influence on the model-fitted $cp\_new$. We also ran a test of DFBETAS, which is the measure of influence pokemon i has on $k^{th}$ regression coefficient. From DFBETAS, we saw that none of the data points had influence on the regression coefficient. Furthermore, we ran a test of Cook's Distance, which is the measure in change in regression by removing each individual point. From Cook's Distance, we saw that 4 of the Eevees had influence on the regression line. Lastly, we ran a VIF test, but we ran into an "aliased coefficients" error which indicated that our model was highly multicollinear such that VIF was essentially undefined. We believed such high multicollinearity is due to the many interaction terms in the model.

One important thing to note is that even though Eevees are influential outliers, our end-decision was that we would still include them in our model since there was no objective reason to remove the Eevees and our users would be equally interested to learn the characteristics of their Eevees pokemon as well.

\subsection{Revisiting Model Selection and Diagnostics} 
We re-ran our model selection process on log-transformed $cp\_new$ and $cp$ which we discovered were necessary for inference from our residual plots. The resulting optimal model including interaction terms was $log(cp\_new)$ ~ $log(cp)$ + $species$ + $attack\_strong\_value$ + $hp$ + $power\_up\_candy$ + $species:hp$ + $log(cp):species$ + $species:power\_up\_candy$ + $species:attack\_strong\_value$. The AIC was -509 and the $R^2$ and adjusted $R^2$ were both 0.999. However, after running a VIF test, we encountered the same "aliased coefficients" error which resulted from the large number of interaction terms included in the model. This led us to question if interaction terms should be eliminated to obtain a more interpretable model while not sacrificing the model's predictive power. Therefore, we re-ran the selection process excluding the interaction terms. The new best model is $log(cp\_new)$ ~ $log(cp)$ + $species$ + $attack\_strong\_value$ + $hp$ + $weight$ with AIC of -502 and 
$R^2$ and adjusted $R^2$ of 0.999. The mean VIF of this model is 4.68.

We further cross-validated the data to compare two model's cv prediction error. The full model(with interactions) has a cv RMSE of 0.108 whereas the reduced model(without interactions) has a cv RSME of 0.0414. Therefore we have strong reason to believe that we should choose the reduced model which has no interaction terms since it has a similar AIC score and equally high $R^2$ and adjusted $R^2$ as the full model with interaction terms. Yet the reduced model has higher predictive power, is not multicollinear and is easier to be interpreted. A residual plot of this model also shows that the technical conditions for inference were satisfied. We thus selected $log(cp\_new)$ ~ $log(cp)$ + $species$ + $attack\_strong\_value$ + $hp$ + $weight$ as our final model.

Lastly, our diagnostics still indicated that Eevees are influential, so it is important to note that out model could look very different if there were no Eevees in the data. Just as a quick aside, we also ran the same model selection steps on the dataset without Eevees. While we won't describe it here, feel free to check it out on our GitHub!  

\subsection{Nested F-test and Interpreting Betas}

When we performed a nested F-test between the final model that we chose and our full model with all interaction terms, we obtained a p-value of 0.003, indicating that we reject $H_0$ that all the $\beta$'s of the additional variables in the full model (namely, the betas of the interaction terms) equal 0, and conclude that at least one of the coefficients was significantly nonzero. However, we decided not to select the interaction model for reasons of over-fitting that we've discussed above.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Holding all other variables constant, a doubling of $cp$ is associated with a multiplicative change of $2^{1.04}$ in the median of $cp\_new$, and this is extremely significant, meaning that we reject $H_0$ that $\beta_{cp}=0$. 

\item Holding all other variables constant, having an Eevee is associated with a multiplicative change of $e^{0.992}$ in the median of $cp\_new$, and this is extremely significant, meaning that we reject $H_0$ that $\beta_{speciesEevee}=0$. 

\item Holding all other variables constant, having a Pidgey is associated with a multiplicative change of $e^{0.591}$ in the median of $cp\_new$, and this is extremely significant, meaning that we reject $H_0$ that $\beta_{speciesPidgey}=0$. 

\item Holding all other variables constant, having a Weedle is associated with a multiplicative change of $e^{0.0177}$ in the median of $cp\_new$, and this is not significant, meaning that we fail to reject $H_0$ that $\beta_{speciesWeedle}=0$.

\item Holding all other variables constant, an increase in $attack\_strong\_value$ of 1 unit is associated with a multiplicative change of $e^{-0.00456}$ in the median of $cp\_new$, and this is extremely significant, meaning that we reject $H_0$ that $\beta_{attack\_strong\_value}=0$. 

\item Holding all other variables constant, an increase in $hp$ of 1 unit is associated with a multiplicative change of $e^{-0.00197}$ in the median of $cp\_new$, and this is significant, meaning that we reject $H_0$ that $\beta_{hp}=0$. 

\item Holding all other variables constant, an increase in $weight$ of 1 unit is associated with a multiplicative change of $e^{-0.000604}$ in the median of $cp\_new$, and this is not significant, meaning that we fail to reject $H_0$ that $\beta_{attack\_strong\_value}=0$. 

\end{enumerate}

```{r, include=FALSE}
final.model<-lm(cp_new_log ~ cp_log + species + attack_strong_value + 
    hp + weight, data = pokemon_logged)
summary(final.model)
```

\subsection{Coefficient of Partial Determination}

\begin{enumerate}

\item $R^2_{Y cp|species, attack\_strong\_value, hp, weight}$
The variability in $cp\_new$ remaining after modeling $cp\_new$ using species, $attack\_strong\_value$, hp, and weight, is reduced by a further 99\% when additionally adding cp to the model. 

\item $R^2_{Y species|cp, attack\_strong\_value, hp, weight}$
The variability in $cp\_new$ remaining after modeling $cp\_new$ using cp, $attack\_strong\_value$, hp, and weight, is reduced by a further 96.1\% when additionally adding species to the model.

\item $R^2_{Y attack\_strong\_value|cp, species, hp, weight}$
The variability in $cp\_new$ remaining after modeling $cp\_new$ using cp, species, hp, and weight, is reduced by a further 31.2\% when additionally adding $attack\_strong\_value$ to the model.

\item $R^2_{Y hp|cp, species, attack\_strong\_value, weight}$
The variability in $cp\_new$ remaining after modeling $cp\_new$ using cp, species, $attack\_strong\_value$, and weight, is reduced by a further 7.67\% when additionally adding hp to the model.

\item $R^2_{Y weight|cp, species, attack\_strong\_value, hp}$
The variability in $cp\_new$ remaining after modeling $cp\_new$ using cp, attack\_strong\_value, hp, and weight, is reduced by a further 2.83\% when additionally adding weight to the model.

\end{enumerate}

From this analysis, we see that cp and species are by far the more important variables in the model. The other variables do contribute to the reduction in variability. 

\section*{Confidence and Prediction Intervals}
After we selected our model, we wanted to see it's prediction ability, so we generated a prediction interval for an individual Pidgey with characteristics we arbitrarily chose. 95% of all Pidgeys with cp = $e^{5.3}$, $attack\_strong\_value$ of 25, hp of 41, and weight of 3 have $cp\_new$ between $e^{5.75}$ and $e^{6.13}$.

In addition to prediction, we were also interested in inference, that is, finding a confidence interval. For the same set of characteristics, we are 95% confident that the median $cp\_new$ for a Pidgey with cp = $e^{5.3}$, $attack\_strong\_value$ of 25, hp of 41, and weight of 3 is be between $e^{5.92}$ and $e^{5.95}$. 


\section*{A Brief Aside on p-values}
We ran 8 hypothesis tests: the nested F-test that we performed on our final model and the t-tests for each of the $\beta$ coefficients. Our p-values would be multiplied by 8, which would not have changed the magnitude of any of the significances of our p-values.

\section*{Conclusion}
The final model we selected was $log(cp\_new)$ ~ $log(cp)$ + species + $attack\_strong\_value$ + $hp$ + $weight$, which was generated from a stepwise linear regression, based on several criteria: AIC, $R^2$, and $R^2_adj$ as well as a guiding principle of avoiding over-fitting without compromising the model's highest predictive potential. Although we saw hp and cp to correlated during our exploratory analysis, there were no serious issues of multicollinearity. We were not surprised by the huge importance that cp and species had in explaining the variability of $cp\_new$. We were surprised that weight was kept in the model since it didn't explain a lot of variability in $cp\_new$; however, given that we are attempting to generate primarily a predictive model, including weight, which provide extra predictive information, is in our best interests.

Overall, we think our model is informative in that it guides Pokemon Go players to focus on specific aspects of their Pokemon to be able to get a sense of whether their evolved Pokemon will have a high cp.
